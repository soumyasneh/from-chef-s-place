Preparing Litti:-

first take wheat flour acording to litties you would be preparing.
                    Now, start adding water slowly
to make dough , dont pour water instanty at once add it slowly until it becomes a nice dough.                    

Now, take sattu according the amount of litti you want to prepare(basically it will be stuffed inside the small dough balls (you will know what it is later in steps)).
add all the ingridents into it except wheat flour.
and similary add water slowy but we are not gonna make dough, here we are just making it a bit hydrating instead of being powdery ( here we are just trying to remove its powderyness)
now mix all of them together and our stuffing is ready.

steps:-

step1-
make small balls out of the dough(wheat flour dough) and shape it into a case on your palm bended inwards.

step2-
now we will stuff those wheat ball cases with our baked gram flour mixture(stuffing we made earier).

now close the opening of wheat cases.

step4-
we are very close to our delicious cusine.
we will keep it on our Barbeque(a roaster having metal roads in it, kept directly on fire).

(optional)
brush all litties with refined butter(ghee).


NOW WE ARE READY TO EAT OUR DELICIOUS CUSINE.
